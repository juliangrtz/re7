# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve BioRand 7. This project sits close to game binaries, reverse-engineered formats, and progression logic, so small, well-tested changes are much easier to review than broad rewrites.

## Good First Contributions

- Fixing documentation gaps or stale commands.
- Adding or tightening xUnit tests around an existing randomizer behavior.
- Improving issue reproduction steps and logs.
- Correcting data rows when the source and in-game behavior are understood.
- Small bug fixes in one modifier, service, command, or generator.

Large feature work is welcome too, but please open an issue first so the design and softlock risks can be discussed.

## Development Setup

```powershell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/juliangrtz/re7.git
cd re7
dotnet restore .\biorand-re7.sln
dotnet build .\biorand-re7.sln --no-restore
dotnet test .\biorand-re7.sln --no-build --verbosity normal
```

If you cloned without submodules:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Use .NET 10. Do not retarget projects to an older framework to make a local machine work.

## Pull Request Expectations

- Keep the PR focused on one behavior or one small family of related changes.
- Include tests for behavior changes where practical.
- Explain any manual in-game validation you performed, especially for progression, enemies, bosses, inventory, chapters, or REFramework features.
- Mention generated files explicitly if the PR changes `_Data`, `GeneratedEnums.cs`, `GeneratedTypes.cs`, binary assets, or submodule pointers.
- Do not commit build outputs, local logs, `GeneratedFiles/`, `TestResults/`, `out/`, `dumps/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `.vs/`, user settings, or local credentials.
- Do not submit copyrighted vanilla game dumps or complete original PAK files.

## Code Guidelines

- Follow the existing C# style: nullable enabled, file-scoped namespaces, and local helper/service patterns.
- Keep randomization deterministic. Use `Randomizer.GetRng(...)` with stable keys instead of time-based or global randomness.
- Prefer typed RE Engine helpers and serializers over string or byte patching when the project already has a structured API.
- Treat `Randomizer.GetModifiers()` order as behavior. Changing it can change output and progression.
- Keep REFramework requirements in sync with `Randomizer.IsREFrameworkRequired()` when adding features that need runtime support.
- Avoid whole-repo format passes, especially over generated files and `src/reeutils/`.

## Data And Generated Files

Runtime data lives in `src/Biohazard.BioRand.RE7/_Data/` and is embedded into the randomizer assembly. Changes there are production behavior changes.

Common data commands:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src\biorand-re7\biorand-re7.csproj -- update
dotnet run --project .\src\Biohazard.BioRand.RE7.DataGen\Biohazard.BioRand.RE7.DataGen.csproj -- generate config
```

Only refresh remote spreadsheet data when that is part of the task. Generated diffs should be easy to explain in the PR.

## Testing Guidance

Use the existing behavior-test helpers:

- `RandomizerTest.CreateFeatureTestConfiguration(...)` disables most features so tests can isolate one behavior.
- `RandomizerTest.RunState(...)` gives before/after file repositories and changed-file snapshots.
- `RandomizerTestPaths` and `RandomizerTestHelpers` centralize common paths and scene readers.

Run at least:

```powershell
dotnet test .\src\Biohazard.BioRand.RE7.Tests\Biohazard.BioRand.RE7.Tests.csproj --verbosity normal
```

Run the full solution test command before opening larger PRs.

## Reporting Bugs

Use the GitHub issue templates. For crashes and softlocks, attach the randomizer's ZIP output, not the Fluffy mod ZIP, and include the location, seed/profile if known, reproduction steps, and any workaround attempts.
